# CLI Mood-Based Chatbot | C++ OOP Project

This is a command-line chatbot built entirely using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.  
The bot responds based on your selected mood to prompts like `hi`, `how are you`, and `bye`.

## 📌 Developed By

This project was developed by **Nouraiz**, a **3rd semester BS Computer Science student** at the **University of Central Punjab, Lahore**.  
It uses only core C++ syllabus concepts—no external or advanced libraries.

## 🔧 Features

- CLI interaction where you select one of four moods:
  - Flirty (`fl`)
  - Funny (`fn`)
  - Angry (`ay`)
  - Formal (`fr`)
- Each mood implemented in its own class file with custom responses
- Mood logic achieved using:
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Runtime Polymorphism** through virtual functions
- Minimal `main()`—only one line to trigger the bot
- File handling used to read responses from `.txt` files
- Clean, modular file organization

---
ll includes and file handling use **relative paths**.  
Make sure your structure stays intact when downloading/cloning.
